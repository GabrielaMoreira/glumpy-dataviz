# Data Visualization with [Glumpy](https://github.com/glumpy/glumpy)

This is some exploring of the glumpy tool with a brazilian weather [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/PROPPG-PPG/hourly-weather-surface-brazil-southeast-region)

Glumpy should be installed  directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/glumpy/glumpy), once the PyPI package is not up to date. So you'll need its dependencies, plus pandas. I'm using Python 3.5.
